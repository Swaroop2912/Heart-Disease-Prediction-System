# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System
Project Description:
Heart Disease Prediction is a project which is developed using the agile software system development techniques. 
This application mainly predicts heart disease probability in an individual. 
The process starts by collecting required information from an individual and analyzing the data using the most accurate algorithm possible.

The key purpose of pursuing this project for a while is to create a heart disease prediction model for the prediction of heart diseaseâ€™s probability in a particular individual. Our project can further be developed and can be used to predict different heart diseases and their treatment. This could be a great opportunity to save lives with a portable application. The process starts by collecting required information from an individual and analyzing the data using the most accurate algorithm possible i.e. Random Forest algorithm. After the analysis, the prediction is presented whether the individual has heart disease or not.This will provide researchers and medical practitioners to establish a better way of finding out the disease.
