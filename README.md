# Heart-Disease-Prediction-System

Project Description:

Heart Disease Prediction is a project which is developed using the agile software system development techniques. 
This application mainly predicts heart disease probability in an individual. 
The process starts by collecting required information from an individual and analyzing the data using the most accurate algorithm possible.

The key purpose of pursuing this project for a while is to create a heart disease prediction model for the prediction of heart diseaseâ€™s probability in a particular individual. Our project can further be developed and can be used to predict different heart diseases and their treatment. This could be a great opportunity to save lives with a portable application. The process starts by collecting required information from an individual and analyzing the data using the most accurate algorithm possible i.e. Random Forest algorithm. After the analysis, the prediction is presented whether the individual has heart disease or not.This will provide researchers and medical practitioners to establish a better way of finding out the disease.

Packages and Libraries:
MYSQL
python
pip 23.0.1
pip install Flask 2.2.3
pip install matplotlib
pip install Seaborn
pip install NumPy 1.24.2
Sklearn version 0.20
pip install Flask_Material


After evaluating the results from the existing methodologies, we have used python and flask operations to perform heart disease classification for the data obtained from the dataset repository. ML process starts from a preprocessing data phase followed by feature selection based on data cleaning, classification of modeling performance evaluation. Random forest technique is used to improve the accuracy of the result.
